                                    grade. Each year, FIRST Robotics reveals a new game in which the teams must design and build a 
                                    robot to complete certain tasks in the game. During my time, the part of the team that I was a 
                                    member of was the build team, which was in charge of designing prototypes and eventually building 
                                    the devices needed to score points in the game.

                                    Knowledge bowl was technically a sport that practiced after school. Practice consisted of getting 
                                    into three teams of four, if there were enough students, and working together to answer trivia 
                                    questions. Each team of four had a buzzer strip on their table and could buzz in whenever they 
                                    liked, but once they did they only had 15 second to talk to their teammates and decide on an 
                                    answer. A few times every year there would be meets in which we traveled to another school to 
                                    compete against other school's teams.
