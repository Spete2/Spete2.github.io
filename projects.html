                            any less proud of what I've accompleshed so far during my time so far here at St. Thomas.

                            really isn't, but I decided the the best thing to start off with would be my very first lab assignment that 
                            I had. This project was my very first expeirience with coding and will always hold a special place in my 
                            heart because of that.

                            balancing binary search tree that we made. I decided on this lab not only becasue I really enjoyed 231, 
                            but also becasue I thought that the idea that we can make a tree that automatically balances itself was 
                            really cool at the time and it was really fun to figure out how to implement that. Shown in the image is
                            the balance method and the tree's iterator.

                        <div class="cell large-6 text">For the final project, I'm choosing one of the assignment that I commited the 
                            most amount of time to getting finished, which is the 4th assignment from CISC 440 AI and Robotics. I
                            pulled an all-nighter to get this assignment done, working on it for about 12 hours straight (not including
                            the occasional break to think, rest, or eat). The assignment itself is a game of tic-tac-toe that has an ai
                            opponent that will always make the most optimal move to counter you. It was written in LISP and the image 
                            shows one of the four funtions used by the ai to find the best move possible.

                        <div class="cell text"> I have a few projects that are either in progress or will be happening this semester 
                            in other classes. The two that I'm most excited about are the two games that I am going to be making in 
                            DIMA 246, Game Design. The other is a personal project that I am going to be slowly working on over this 
                            semester using the skills I learn in this class to make a website. I also hope to start working on a game 
                            of my own over J-term so I can hopefully get it finished by the time graduation rolls around!
